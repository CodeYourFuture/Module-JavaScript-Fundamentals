Open a new window in Chrome, right click an empty space on the page, select **Inspect** from the dropdown, then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console, invoke the function `alert` with one argument, the string `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
It is used to alert the user about something very important. One cannot access the rest of their screen until they manually turn it off (that's why it should only be used when no other way of notification would do the job).

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
What is the return value of `prompt`?
It also pops up/overlays the screen, in this case it asks the user to input some data. The return value of the prompt is the one specified in the variable attached to it (in this case, )
