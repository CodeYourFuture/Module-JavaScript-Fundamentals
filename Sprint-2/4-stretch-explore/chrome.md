Open a new window in Chrome, right click an empty space on the page, select **Inspect** from the dropdown, then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console, invoke the function `alert` with one argument, the string `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
alert(): shows the message to the users. in this case show "Hello world!" in the box and we can close it or click on the ok.

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
prompt(): returns whatever the user enters. It is provide a textbox that we can type on it.
What is the return value of `prompt`?
The Return value of prompt is the text enter by user. in this example return name that we write in the box.
