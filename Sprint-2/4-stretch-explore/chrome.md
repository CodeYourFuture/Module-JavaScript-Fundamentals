Open a new window in Chrome, right click an empty space on the page, select **Inspect** from the dropdown, then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console, invoke the function `alert` with one argument, the string `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
Message window at the top, that takes over the window with the message of the argument

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
What is the return value of `prompt`?

prompt creates a window at the top with a text input box, with the message passed as the argument
the return value is whatever was written in the box
