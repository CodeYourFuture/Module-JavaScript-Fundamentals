Open a new window in Chrome, right click an empty space on the page, select **Inspect** from the dropdown, then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console, invoke the function `alert` with one argument, the string `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
It shows a pop-up dialog box with the message "Hello world!" and pauses the browser until the user closes it.

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
It displays a dialog box asking the user for input.

What is the return value of `prompt`?
The return value is the text entered by the user as a string. If the user cancels the prompt, it returns `null`.
