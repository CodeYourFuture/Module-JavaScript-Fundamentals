const minimum = 1;
const maximum = 100;

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing
// Breakdown of the expression
// 1. Math.random() this generates a decimal number from 0 up to , but not including 1
//num represents a random number between minimum and maximum
